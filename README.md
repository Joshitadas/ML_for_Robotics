Attempting to store my understanding of Machine Learning from classes in University.

## K-Means Clustering code from scratch:

This file will help one understand the complete logic behind the K-Means clustering. It uses make_blobs from sklearn to create a dataset with k centres. Further uses the algorithm to:
  * Select k random points as the starting centroid
  * Each cluster must be assigned to a cluster based on the distance
  * Based on each cluster averaging is done to find a new centroid/ mean
  * Repeat step 2 and step 3 until:
      1. The centroids do not change.
      2. The number of iterations specified is over.
